translations/                  # Translation workflow management
├── metadata/                 # Translation tracking
    └── translation-status.json
```

## 2. Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Content Creation (English)

1. **Write English version first**: Begin with well-drafted English content in `content/blog/en/`.
2. **Standard frontmatter**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "How AI Transforms Customer Service in 2024"
   metatitle: "AI Customer Service Transformation 2024 | Seasalt.ai"
   description: "Discover how AI is revolutionizing customer service..."
   author: "Alex Rodriguez"
   date: "2024-01-15"
   tags: ["AI", "Customer Service", "Automation"]
   image_thumbnail: "/images/blog/ai-customer-service-2024.jpg"
   translation_key: "ai-customer-service-2024"
   translation_priority: "high"
   ---
   ```

### Phase 2: Automated Translation Management

1. **Auto-Generate Translation Files**
   - Use scripts to automatically generate translation placeholders for all target languages from the English source.

2. **Use AI Translation Service**
   - Leverage services like OpenAI or Google Translate to provide complete translations.

3. **Translation Status Tracking**
   - Maintain a JSON-based system to track completion.

### Phase 3: Full AI Translation Process

1. **Automated AI Service Integration**
   - Setup API integrations for translation services.

2. **Post-Translation Automation**
   - Update metadata to indicate completion.
   - Deploy immediately to production.

3. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Ensure live production reflects latest translations.

## 3. User Experience Flow

- **Language Detection & Switching**: Automatically detect and present the preferred language based on user settings and browser.
- **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Use language-sensitive URLs and keep sitemaps updated to ensure search visibility.

## 4. Monitoring System

- **Monitoring Dashboard**:
  - Track translation success and API usage.
  - Ensure coverage and alert for failed processes.

## 5. SEO & Technical Implementation

- **Hreflang Tags**: Properly implement to guide search engines.
- **Sitemap Updates**: Ensure all URLs are indexed as translations complete.

## 6. CLI Commands

```bash
# Full translation
npm run blog:translate-all [slug]

# Monitor translation pipeline
npm run blog:monitor-translations

# Check statuses
npm run blog:check-translation-status

# Deploy
npm run blog:deploy-translations
```

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **AI Translation Improvements**: Continuously incorporate the latest in AI APIs for better accuracy.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize serverless functions and caching for speed.

This system design focuses on scalability and ease of implementation, ensuring all content is accessible globally with minimal latency and maximum automation. For additional details or support, refer to the technical documentation within the repository.
