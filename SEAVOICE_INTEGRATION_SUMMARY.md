# SeaVoice Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the SeaVoice website into the main seasalt.ai website to serve under the `/seavoice` route.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Migration
- **Source**: Copied all code from `../new-seavoice-website/src/` to `src/seavoice/`
- **Structure**: Preserved original SeaVoice folder structure:
  - `src/seavoice/components/` - Header, Footer, VoiceDemo components
  - `src/seavoice/pages/` - All SeaVoice pages including platform and solutions
  - `src/seavoice/utils/` - SeaVoice router component

### 2. Routing Integration
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added SeaVoice routes similar to SeaChat and SeaX
- **Routes**: 
  - `/seavoice` → redirects to `/{DEFAULT_LANGUAGE}/seavoice`
  - `/{lang}/seavoice/*` → serves SeaVoice content for all supported languages

### 3. Header Enhancement
- **File**: `src/seavoice/components/Header.tsx`
- **Enhancement**: Added language switcher from main website
- **Features**:
  - Language dropdown with all supported languages
  - Proper language-aware URL handling for SeaVoice paths
  - Mobile-responsive language selector
  - Preserves original SeaVoice header design and navigation

### 4. Footer Preservation
- **File**: `src/seavoice/components/Footer.tsx`
- **Status**: Kept original SeaVoice footer design and branding

### 5. Product Data Update
- **File**: `src/data/productsData.ts`
- **Change**: Updated SeaVoice href from `http://voice.seasalt.ai/` to `/seavoice`
- **Impact**: SeaVoice now shows as internal link in main website header

### 6. Dependencies
- **Added**: `framer-motion` package for SeaVoice animations
- **Status**: Installed successfully

## Language Support
- All 18 supported languages work with SeaVoice

- **Sub-pages**: `/en/seavoice/platform`, `/en/seavoice/solutions`, etc.

## Build Notes
