## SAP Conversational AI: A Chatbot System Stuck in the Past.

SAP Conversational AI has established itself as a platform for building chatbots within the SAP ecosystem. Its integration with existing SAP solutions and low-code development environment has simplified chatbot creation for SAP users. Here are some advantages of SAP Conversational AI:

- **SAP Integration**: Seamless integration with other SAP solutions simplifies development for organizations already invested in the SAP ecosystem.
- **Low-code Development**: The visual interface allows for building chatbots with minimal code, making it easy to use for a wide range of developers.
- **Multi-language Support**: SAP Conversational AI supports multiple languages, allowing your chatbot to reach more customers.

However, SAP Conversational AI also limits the chatbot's capabilities:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Due to its rule-based engine, SAP Conversational AI may struggle to understand complex user queries and adapt to context.
- **Scripted Conversations**: Chatbot conversations built with SAP Conversational AI can feel rigid and scripted, lacking natural fluidity.
- **Potential Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy reliance on SAP integration may limit flexibility and scalability for businesses outside the SAP ecosystem.

## SeaChat: Next-Generation Chatbot, AI Assistant

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a paradigm shift in conversational AI, allowing you to transcend the limitations of traditional chatbot platforms:
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: SeaChat excels at understanding the nuances of human language, enabling it to conduct natural, context-based conversations. This allows SeaChat to understand the intent of a user's query, even if it's phrased differently than expected.
- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat is a continuously learning system, constantly evolving and adapting based on user interactions. This enables it to handle increasingly complex queries over time, ensuring your chatbot remains effective as user needs become more sophisticated.
