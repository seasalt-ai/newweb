The world of chatbots is evolving at an astonishing pace. While [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) has been a popular choice for building voice and text interfaces, a new technology wave is becoming the center of attention: Large Language Models (LLMs). [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform powered by LLMs, provides a revolutionary approach to conversational AI, leaving rule-based engines like Lex far behind. Is it time to consider upgrading your chatbot?

## Amazon Lex: A Chatbot System Stuck in the Past

Amazon Lex has established itself as a tool for building chatbots. Its drag-and-drop interface and integration with other AWS services make it a user-friendly choice. Here are some advantages of Lex:

- **Easy to Use**: The visual interface simplifies chatbot creation, minimizing the need for coding expertise.
- **Quick Deployment**: Lex allows for rapid chatbot development and deployment, ideal for quick projects.
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services simplifies development within the AWS ecosystem.

However, Lex has limitations that can hinder your chatbot's capabilities:

- **Scripted Conversations**: Lex relies on predefined intents and utterances, leading to rigid and unnatural conversation flows.
- **Limited NLU**: Understanding complex user queries and adapting to context can be challenging for Lex.
- **Scalability Issues**: Performance may decline when handling many user interactions.

## SeaChat: Paving the Way for the Future of Chatbots

- **Seamless User Experience**: By understanding context and intent, SeaChat promotes more natural conversation flows, mimicking human interactions.

Here's why SeaChat is the future of chatbots:

- **Natural Conversations**: Users crave chatbots that feel like talking to a real person, exactly what SeaChat delivers through LLM technology.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Building chatbots with SeaChat requires less code compared to rule-based engines, saving you time and resources.

Research has shown that the difference between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU in terms of training examples is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): in training data requirements, it's 630,000 examples versus just 32. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings when businesses adopt GenAI/LLM-based NLU.
