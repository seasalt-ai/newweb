Taiwan is gradually entering a super-aged society, with the number of seniors living alone continuously increasing. According to National Development Council data, Taiwan's elderly population ratio is expected to reach nearly 20% by 2024 and officially enter a super-aged society in 2025. This social structure change has brought the physical and mental health issues of seniors living alone into focus. Particularly, many seniors often feel lonely and worry about the possibility of dying alone at home. These psychological pressures not only affect their quality of life but also pose threats to their physical health.

## Senior Loneliness and Health Issues

Seniors living alone often lack daily social interactions, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. This loneliness not only affects seniors' mental health but also increases their risk of various diseases. For example, research shows that loneliness may lead to increased rates of hypertension, depression, and cardiovascular diseases. Other studies indicate that seniors living alone have a 27% higher risk of developing dementia compared to the general population. Additionally, seniors living alone often worry that if they have an accident at home, they may not receive timely help. This fear further exacerbates their psychological stress and even increases their risk of dying alone.

To address the above issues, SeaX provides a comprehensive AI voice assistant solution specifically designed for seniors living alone, aimed at improving their quality of life and reducing their loneliness. Through SeaX's smart care calls, seniors can interact with the system anytime, regularly receive caring greetings from AI, and get immediate support when needed.

### Regular Care and Health Monitoring
The SeaX system can make scheduled care calls to conduct simple health inquiries with seniors, such as sleep conditions and dietary status. This information is automatically recorded in the system and promptly notifies relevant caregivers when there are abnormal situations, ensuring seniors receive timely care and attention.

### Personalized Emotional Companionship
Through SeaX's AI technology, the system can provide personalized conversation content based on seniors' personal preferences, thereby reducing their loneliness. The AI assistant can also share news, music, or topics of interest with seniors, making them feel the warmth of companionship and alleviating their loneliness and anxiety.

### Immediate Emergency Response
When seniors encounter emergencies at home, the SeaX system can immediately notify their family members or emergency contacts and automatically make help calls as needed, ensuring seniors receive necessary assistance as soon as possible and reducing health risks associated with loneliness.

## Case Study: Successful Application of Care Calls

Taking a Singapore social service organization as an example, the organization significantly improved the quality of care services for seniors by introducing the SeaX system. The organization conducts annual care calls with thousands of seniors each year. Due to the cumbersome process and difficulty in efficient management, traditional manual methods could not meet the demand. After introducing SeaX, the frequency of care calls increased from once per year to once per month, greatly improving care for seniors and their quality of life. The AI voice assistant can not only automatically make outbound care calls but also conduct surveys and health monitoring based on seniors' personal needs, further understanding each senior's specific requirements.
Through SeaX, the organization successfully reduced volunteer workload, allowing volunteers to focus their energy on more meaningful care work. Meanwhile, the system can track seniors' health conditions in real-time, ensuring every senior receives immediate care and support.

## Conclusion
The loneliness and health issues of seniors living alone are challenges that cannot be ignored in today's society. Through SeaX's smart care call solution, we can not only provide regular health monitoring and emotional companionship for seniors but also provide immediate help in emergency situations, making seniors feel safe and cared for even at home. The application of this technology not only improves seniors' quality of life but also brings more warmth and care to our society.
