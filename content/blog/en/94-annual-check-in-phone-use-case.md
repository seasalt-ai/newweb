## Challenges Faced by Long-term Care

### Insufficient Annual Care Frequency:
Traditionally, the organization could only conduct one phone check-in with each senior per year. This frequency is insufficient to promptly identify and address potential health issues or emergencies.

### Strained Volunteer Resources:
Each annual check-in requires significant volunteer input, often requiring volunteers to work almost full-time on these tasks. Due to limited resources, service quality is difficult to guarantee.

### Inadequate Follow-up:
In traditional care models, if seniors miss calls, it's usually difficult to conduct timely follow-ups, which may lead to potential issues being overlooked.

### Lack of Service Personalization:
Due to the relatively fixed content of phone check-ins, it's impossible to provide personalized advice or care based on each senior's specific situation, leading to some needs not being fully met.

### Untimely Emergency Response:
If seniors encounter emergencies outside of check-in times, there's a lack of timely communication channels, which may lead to delayed handling and increased risks.

## Solution: SeaX Implementation

### Increased Care Frequency:
After introducing SeaX, the organization increased care call frequency from once per year to once per month. This high-frequency checking not only improves care for seniors but also enables earlier identification and handling of potential issues, ensuring seniors receive more timely care.

### Automated Care Calls:
SeaX's AI voice assistant can automatically make outbound care calls, so volunteers no longer need to spend significant time and effort on highly repetitive phone check-in work. The AI assistant can contact thousands of seniors in automated mode and conduct surveys as needed to better understand each senior's specific needs.

### Immediate Follow-up and Callbacks:
If a senior misses a call, SeaX will automatically call back to ensure every senior receives care. Additionally, the system can automatically track and investigate incomplete surveys and promptly notify relevant personnel for follow-up.

### Personalized Care Plans:
Through AI technology, SeaX can provide personalized care plans based on each senior's health status and lifestyle habits, including exclusive health advice and reminders.

### Immediate Emergency Response:
The SeaX system can automatically notify relevant personnel when seniors encounter emergencies and provide immediate support and assistance, ensuring seniors receive necessary help in critical moments.

## Results and Impact

Through SeaX, the organization not only significantly improved the quality of care services but also substantially reduced volunteer workload, making the entire system operation more efficient. This case fully demonstrates the enormous potential of AI technology in senior care, providing continuous and personalized care for more seniors through automated, intelligent care services.
