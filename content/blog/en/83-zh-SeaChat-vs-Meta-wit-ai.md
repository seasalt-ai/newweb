The world of chatbots is evolving at an astonishing pace. While Meta/Facebook's [wit.ai](http://wit.ai) served as a stepping stone for building voice-driven applications, a new wave of technology is slowly taking center stage: Large Language Models (LLMs). [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform built on LLM technology, offers a groundbreaking approach to conversational AI, leaving intent-based engines like wit.ai far behind. Is it time to consider an upgrade for your chatbot?

### wit.ai: A Simple Entry Point, But Limited Scope

wit.ai has been a user-friendly platform, often used for building basic voice interfaces. Its focus on intent recognition technology allows developers to quickly get started and apply it simply.

Here are some advantages of wit.ai:

- **Accessibility**: The intuitive interface simplifies the creation of basic voice interfaces, making it a good choice for beginners or small-scale projects.
- **Focus on Intent Recognition**: Extracting user intent from spoken language is at the core of wit.ai's functionality. This can be helpful for tasks that only require simple user input.
- **Free Plan**: wit.ai offers a free plan, making it an option for developers with limited budgets or for experimenting with voice applications.

However, as your chatbot project grows in complexity, wit.ai's limitations become apparent:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Understanding the nuances of human language and context is beyond wit.ai's capabilities. This leads to a rigid and unnatural conversation flow.
- **Scripted Interactions**: wit.ai primarily relies on predefined intents, forcing conversations to follow a rigid path. This cannot capture the dynamic nature of spoken language.
- **Scalability Issues**: Performance may degrade when handling large volumes of user interactions, hindering growth potential.

## SeaChat: Paving the Way for the Future of Conversational AI

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a huge leap in conversational AI, leaving wit.ai's limitations behind:
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: LLMs excel at understanding the nuances of human language, enabling SeaChat to conduct natural, context-driven conversations with users.
- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, constantly improving its ability to handle complex queries.
- **Seamless User Experience**: By understanding context and intent, SeaChat facilitates a more natural, human-like conversational flow.

Here's why SeaChat can elevate your conversational AI:

- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Users crave chatbots that feel like talking to a real person, and this is what SeaChat delivers through LLM technology. This creates a more engaging and satisfying user experience.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Compared to intent-based engines like wit.ai, building chatbots with SeaChat typically requires less code. This frees up development resources to build robust functionalities.
- **Growing Scalability**: SeaChat effortlessly handles large volumes of user interactions, ensuring smooth operation even during peak times. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses with high growth potential.

Research has shown that the difference in training examples between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): 630,000 examples versus just 32. This drastic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings when businesses adopt GenAI/LLM-based NLU.
