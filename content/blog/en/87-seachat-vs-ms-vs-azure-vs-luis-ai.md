The conversational AI world is excited about the latest news of Microsoft and OpenAI's deepening partnership. While some celebrate the potential of this collaboration, there are also voices of discontent within Microsoft. According to reports, insiders worry that this will deviate from internal AI development to promote OpenAI products.

One area specifically mentioned is the fate of Microsoft's Azure Bot Service. Internal sources suggest it may "[more or less disappear](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2024/03/microsoft-insiders-fear-firm-has.html)," replaced by OpenAI solutions.

[Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and [Azure AI Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-bot-service) (as well as [LUIS.ai](http://LUIS.ai)) are a collection of libraries, tools, and services that allow you to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots. However, the [Bot Framework SDK's GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk) hasn't been updated for over 2 years (as of 2024) except for the README:

## What's the Alternative to Microsoft Bot Framework for Developers?

SeaChat enters: **The LLM Challenger**

While Microsoft contemplates its AI strategy, Seasalt.ai is drawing attention with its LLM-powered (Large Language Model) conversational platform [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog). SeaChat leverages the latest advances in natural language understanding to provide a more natural and intuitive user experience than traditional rule-based chatbots.

**Here's why SeaChat might be well-positioned to lead the conversational AI revolution**:
- **The Power of LLM**:
  Leveraging the power of LLM for more nuanced conversations.
  Better understanding of context and intent.
  Making user interactions more natural and fluid.
- **Flexibility**:
  Adapting and learning when interacting with users.
  Continuously improving the ability to provide relevant and useful responses.
  Handling complex queries and requests over time.
- **Seamless Integration**:
  Seamless integration with various platforms and applications.
  Easy deployment of chatbots across different channels.
  Providing omnichannel support for a unified customer experience.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Building complex chatbots with minimal code requirements.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminating the need for large amounts of training data and resources.
- **Scalability**: Easily handling high-volume queries without performance impact.

## Drawbacks of Azure Bot Service and Microsoft Bot Framework
While Azure Bot Services and Microsoft Bot Framework have their uses, they come with some drawbacks:
- **Rule-based Limitations**: Relying on predefined rules can lead to rigid conversations and difficulty handling unexpected user inputs.
- **Development Complexity**: Building and maintaining complex chatbots may require considerable coding expertise.
- **Limited Scalability**: Managing high-volume queries can become challenging, affecting performance.
- **Integration Challenges**: Integrating with various platforms may require additional development work.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependence on Microsoft's ecosystem may limit flexibility and future choices.
- **Uncertain Future with OpenAI**: Microsoft's shift toward OpenAI solutions creates uncertainty about long-term Bot Framework support.

## Comparison of Traditional Intent/Entity-based NLU vs. LLM-based NLU

Research shows that the difference between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog). In terms of training instances, it's 630,000 instances versus just 32. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings for businesses adopting GenAI/LLM-based NLU.
