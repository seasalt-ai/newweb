With the advent of large language models like ChatGPT, generative AI has opened up new realms of exploration. When combined with speech recognition, it offers unprecedented possibilities for real-time meeting analysis. But what does this mean for daily business operations?

What is a meeting copilot? Let's find out!

--------------------------

# The Value of Meeting Recordings

1. **Accurate Recording**: It is extremely important to accurately record meetings. Consider that in a meeting involving multiple departments or stakeholders, missing any small detail could lead to decision-making errors. Transcribing speech to text in real time not only ensures that every word is captured but also avoids human errors or omissions.

   **For example**: In a product launch meeting, the marketing department proposed a new advertising strategy. If this strategy is not fully recorded, it could lead to errors in the promotional campaign when the product is launched.

2. **Quick Understanding**: The modern business environment is constantly changing, and employees may need to join meetings at any time. Having a live transcript feature means that new participants can quickly understand the discussion instead of waiting for other participants to spend time explaining.

   **For example**: When an employee from the finance department is late due to other tasks, they can quickly review the transcript without interrupting the meeting flow.

3. **Instant Review**: In long meetings, participants may need to review previous discussions. Live summaries or transcripts provide this possibility, making meetings more efficient without the need to repeat the same content.

   **For example**: In a strategy design meeting, participants can review summaries of previous discussions at any time to ensure that new strategy plans are consistent with previous discussions.

## Groups in Need of Real-Time Meeting Analysis

1. **Large Enterprises**: These companies often have multiple departments collaborating across geographical regions or time zones. Real-time meeting analysis ensures information consistency and effective communication.

   **For example**: Branches of a multinational company in Asia and Europe can conduct strategy discussions synchronously through real-time translation and transcription, ensuring that each team understands the company's overall direction.

2. **Individual Studios and SMEs**: For these small organizations, resources may be limited. Real-time meeting analysis provides a cost-effective way to ensure that all important information is recorded.

   **For example**: When meeting with clients, a small advertising agency can ensure that all requirements and expectations are recorded through live transcription, reducing subsequent misunderstandings and errors.


3. **Multinational Corporations**: For companies operating in multilingual environments, real-time meeting analysis and language conversion have become basic requirements.

   **For example**: In a global meeting of a multinational company, colleagues who speak English, Chinese, and Spanish can simultaneously obtain transcripts in the languages they need, ensuring the accuracy of the information.

## Advantages of Real-Time Meeting Analysis

1. **Increased Efficiency**: Avoiding repetitive content and ensuring that all participants can track the progress of the meeting can greatly increase work efficiency.

   **For example**: In a project review meeting, the team can quickly review previous decisions and results instead of wasting time re-discussing them.
