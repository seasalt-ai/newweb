With the development of technology, AI meeting assistants have become a key tool for improving meeting efficiency. These tools can automatically provide meeting summaries, convert speech to text, and even automatically identify important information in meetings. This article will explore three major meeting AI assistants: Microsoft Teams' Copilot, Google Meet's Duet AI, and SeaMeet.

> **Key Information**:
> - **Teams Copilot**: Provides a meeting summary function, but does not support Chinese and prioritizes Simplified Chinese.
> - **Google Meet Duet AI**: Provides an automatic subtitle conversion function, but does not currently support Chinese.
> - **SeaMeet**: Supports Traditional Chinese and provides real-time transcripts, summaries, and other functions.

# **Microsoft Teams' Meeting Copilot**

Microsoft Teams provides users with a feature called Copilot, designed to provide meeting summaries to help participants better track and participate in meetings. This feature can:
- Capture important decisions and action items in the meeting.
- Provide real-time feedback, allowing participants to adjust their participation at any time.
- Automatically record and analyze meetings, providing subsequent summaries and suggestions.

# **Google Meet's Duet AI**

Google Meet has introduced a new feature for its users called Duet AI, which mainly provides automatic subtitle conversion, making it easier for non-native speakers to follow the meeting content. However, this feature currently has some limitations:
1. Duet AI does not currently support Chinese, especially Traditional Chinese.
2. The main development and support focus is still on English and other major languages.
3. Many users have questioned the accuracy of its subtitles.

> **Key Information**:
> - **Function**: Duet AI provides automatic subtitle conversion.
> - **Language Support**: Does not currently support Chinese.
> - **Accuracy**: Some users question the accuracy of its subtitles.

# **SeaMeet Features**

Compared to the other two platforms, SeaMeet performs particularly well in its support for Traditional Chinese. Not only does it fully support Traditional Chinese, but it also provides similar or more advanced features than Microsoft Copilot and Google Meet copilot:
- Provides real-time transcripts in Chinese and English, allowing participants to instantly follow the meeting content.
- Automatically generates meeting summaries and topics for easy review by participants.
- Automatically generates Google Docs for each meeting after the meeting to enhance team collaboration.
- Encrypted permission management for workspaces and meeting recording users.
- High degree of customization, allowing users to adjust its functions and settings according to their needs.


# **Comparison of SeaMeet with Other Platforms**

When we compare SeaMeet with the other two platforms, we can see that each platform has its own unique advantages and limitations. However, for users who want full support for Traditional Chinese, SeaMeet is currently the best choice. Microsoft and Google may not immediately support the latest features for Traditional Chinese users, and even if they do, it remains to be seen whether they are suitable for the habits of Traditional Chinese users.

Here is a simple comparison of the three meeting assistant Copilots:

- **Comprehensive Functions**: Compared to Google Meet's Duet AI and Teams' Copilot, SeaMeet provides more comprehensive functions, including real-time transcripts, summaries, and topics.
- **Language Support**: SeaMeet fully supports Traditional Chinese, while the other two still have room for improvement in this area.

> **Key Information**:
> - **Functions**: SeaMeet provides real-time transcripts, summaries, and topics.
> - **Language Support**: Fully supports Traditional Chinese.

# **Conclusion**

| Platform | |Chinese Support |
|:-----------------------------------:|----------|:-----------------:|
| Teams Copilot || Does not support Chinese, will prioritize the launch of Simplified Chinese functions |
| Google Meet | |Meetings have Traditional Chinese transcripts, but the meeting copilot does not support Chinese |
| SeaMeet || Supports Traditional Chinese, provides real-time transcripts, summaries, etc. |


With the rapid development of technology, AI meeting assistants have become an indispensable tool for modern enterprises. Different platforms provide different functions to meet the needs of different users. However, for users who want full support for Traditional Chinese, SeaMeet is undoubtedly the best choice. When choosing a suitable AI meeting assistant, users should carefully compare the functions, language support, and customer feedback of different platforms to ensure that they choose the most suitable tool for themselves.
