# Enhanced Content Management with Modified Date Support

This blog post demonstrates the new `modified_date` feature in our blog system, which provides enhanced SEO capabilities and better content lifecycle management.

## What's New

The blog system now supports a `modified_date` field in the YAML frontmatter that:

- **Improves SEO**: Search engines can better understand when content was last updated
- **Enhances User Experience**: Readers can see when articles were last updated
- **Better Content Management**: Track content freshness and update cycles

## How It Works

### YAML Frontmatter

Simply add the `modified_date` field to your blog post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
metatitle: "SEO Title"
description: "Meta description for SEO"
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
date: 2024-01-15T10:00:00-08:00
modified_date: 2024-01-26T16:41:48-08:00  # Last updated date

---
```

### SEO Benefits

The `modified_date` field is automatically used in:

1. **Open Graph Tags**: `article:modified_time`
2. **Structured Data**: JSON-LD `dateModified` property
3. **Search Engine Meta**: Helps with content freshness signals

### User Interface

When a blog post has been modified:

- **Blog Listing**: Shows "Updated: [date]" alongside the publication date
- **Individual Posts**: Displays both "Published" and "Updated" dates
- **Search Results**: Enhanced with last modified information

## Technical Implementation

The system automatically:

- Parses the `modified_date` from YAML frontmatter
- Normalizes date formats for consistency
- Falls back to `date` if `modified_date` is not provided
- Generates proper meta tags and structured data

## Content Strategy

Use the `modified_date` field when:

- **Updating Facts**: Product information, pricing, features
- **Adding Content**: New sections, examples, case studies
- **Correcting Errors**: Factual corrections, typos, broken links
- **Seasonal Updates**: Refreshing content for current relevance

## Best Practices

1. **Update Meaningfully**: Only change `modified_date` for substantial content updates
2. **Keep Accurate**: Ensure the modified date reflects when content actually changed
3. **Document Changes**: Consider adding an "Updates" section for major revisions
4. **SEO Timing**: Space out updates to avoid appearing unstable to search engines

This feature helps maintain content freshness and provides better transparency to both users and search engines about when content was last updated.
