The world of chatbots is evolving rapidly. While [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) has been a popular choice for building voice and text interfaces, a new wave of technology is taking center stage: Large Language Models (LLMs).  [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform powered by LLMs, offers a groundbreaking approach to Conversational AI, leaving rule-based engines like Lex behind.  Is it time to consider an upgrade for your chatbot?

## Amazon Lex: A Reliable Workhorse, But Stuck in the Past

Amazon Lex has established itself as a workhorse for building chatbots. Its drag-and-drop interface and integration with other AWS services make it a user-friendly option. Here are some of Lex's strengths:

- **Ease of Use**: The visual interface simplifies chatbot creation, minimizing the need for coding expertise.
- **Quick Deployment**: Lex allows for rapid chatbot development and deployment, ideal for quick projects.
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services streamlines development within the AWS ecosystem.

However, Lex also has limitations that can hinder your chatbot's capabilities:

- **Scripted Conversations**: Lex relies on predefined intents and utterances, leading to a rigid and unnatural conversation flow.
- **Limited NLU**: Understanding complex user queries and adapting to context can be challenging for Lex.
- **Scalability Concerns**: Performance may decline when handling high volumes of user interactions.
