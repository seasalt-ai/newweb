The world of conversational AI is echoing with innovation. While [Nuance Mix NLU](https://www.nuance.com/omni-channel-customer-engagement/ai-for-developers/nuance-mix.html) has proven itself as a powerful tool for understanding user intent, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a compelling alternative. [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/), a platform built on LLM technology, showcases the potential future of conversational AI.


## Nuance Mix NLU: The Foundation of Conversational Applications

Nuance Mix NLU has been a cornerstone for many conversational AI projects. Its ability to interpret user utterances across various channels (text, voice) empowers businesses to develop effective chatbots and virtual assistants.

- **Omnichannel Support**: Nuance Mix NLU operates across different channels, providing flexibility in user interactions.
- **Industry Expertise**: Nuance has years of experience in speech recognition and NLU, offering a robust solution.
- **Customization**: The platform allows developers to customize the NLU engine based on specific industry needs and terminology. But they may have scalability issues.

## Disadvantages of Nuance Mix NLU:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding**: Nuance Mix NLU often struggles to accurately comprehend and interpret user input, leading to user frustration and reduced effectiveness.
- **Complex Development Process**: Building and deploying conversational AI with Nuance Mix NLU can be cumbersome and time-consuming, requiring specialized skills and expertise.
- **Lack of Scalability**: As businesses scale and interaction volumes increase, Nuance Mix NLU may struggle to keep up with demand, leading to performance issues and scalability challenges.
- **Limited Customization Options**: Nuance Mix NLU offers limited customization options, making it difficult for businesses to tailor the conversational experience to their unique needs and requirements.

## The Power of LLMs: The Rise of SeaChat

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a unique approach to conversational AI:

Research has shown that the difference in training examples between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): 630,000 examples versus just 32. This drastic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings when businesses adopt GenAI/LLM-based NLU.

## SeaChat Can Provide a Better Conversational Experience
The conversational AI landscape is constantly evolving. While Nuance Mix NLU has been a leader, LLM-based solutions like [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) showcase a future where natural language interactions become the norm. Understanding these developments is crucial for choosing the right tool for your conversational AI journey.
