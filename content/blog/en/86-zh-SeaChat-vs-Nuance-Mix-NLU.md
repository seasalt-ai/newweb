The world of conversational AI echoes with innovation. While [Nuance Mix NLU](https://www.nuance.com/omni-channel-customer-engagement/ai-for-developers/nuance-mix.html) has proven itself as a powerful tool for understanding user intent, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a compelling alternative. [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/), a platform based on LLM technology, showcases the potential future of conversational AI.

## Nuance Mix NLU: The Foundation of Conversational Applications

Nuance Mix NLU is the cornerstone of many conversational AI projects. Its ability to interpret user utterances across various channels (text, voice) empowers businesses to develop effective chatbots and virtual assistants.

- **Omnichannel Support**: Nuance Mix NLU operates across different channels, providing flexibility in user interaction.
- **Industry Expertise**: Nuance has years of experience in speech recognition and NLU, offering a robust solution.
- **Customization**: The platform allows developers to customize NLU engines based on specific industry requirements and terminology. But they may have scalability issues.

## Disadvantages of Nuance Mix NLU:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding**: Nuance Mix NLU often struggles with accurately understanding and interpreting user input, leading to user experience frustration and reduced effectiveness.
- **Complex Development Process**: Building and deploying conversational AI with Nuance Mix NLU can be cumbersome and time-consuming, requiring specialized skills and expertise.
- **Lack of Scalability**: As business scales expand and interaction volumes increase, Nuance Mix NLU may struggle to keep up with demand, leading to performance issues and scalability challenges.
- **Limited Customization Options**: Nuance Mix NLU offers limited customization options, making it difficult for businesses to tailor the conversational experience to their unique needs and requirements.

## The Power of LLMs: The Rise of SeaChat

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a unique approach to conversational AI:
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: LLMs excel at understanding the nuances of human language, enabling SeaChat to conduct more natural and contextually relevant conversations.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, improving its ability to handle complex queries over time.
- **Simplified Development**: LLM-based platforms typically require less code than traditional NLU engines, accelerating chatbot creation.

## The Big Picture

While Nuance Mix NLU has been a dominant force, there are reasons to believe that SeaChat's LLM approach may become increasingly attractive:

- **Natural Conversations**: Users typically prefer chatbots that feel like natural conversations, which is a strength of LLM technology.
- **Development Efficiency**: Faster development cycles driven by reduced code requirements can be a significant advantage in today's fast-paced business environment.
- **Scalability Potential**: LLMs may be easier to handle large volumes of queries compared to traditional NLU engines.

## Choosing Between Nuance Mix NLU and SeaChat: Selecting the Right Tool

The ideal platform for your conversational AI project depends on your specific needs:

- **Nuance Mix NLU** might be a good choice if:
  - You have existing investments in the Nuance ecosystem, such as on [Genesys Cloud](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/nuance-mix-integration-overview/).
  - You need to balance natural language understanding with control over specific responses.
- **SeaChat** might be a strong contender if:
  - Natural conversation flow and development convenience are top priorities.
  - You're looking for a future-proof solution with high scalability potential.

Research has shown that the difference between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU in terms of training examples is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): in training data requirements, it's 630,000 examples versus just 32. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings when businesses adopt GenAI/LLM-based NLU.

## SeaChat Can Provide Better Conversational Experiences
The conversational AI landscape is constantly evolving. While Nuance Mix NLU has been a leader, LLM-based solutions like [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) showcase a future where natural language interactions become the norm. Understanding these developments is crucial for choosing the right tool for your conversational AI journey.
