Does your chatbot feel repetitive and unnatural? Do you want to provide your customers with a more natural chat experience? Then it's time to look at SeaChat, a powerful AI assistant product built on large language models (LLMs). While [IBM Watson NLU](https://www.ibm.com/products/natural-language-understanding) has been a reliable tool for text analysis, [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) offers a revolutionary approach to conversational AI, leaving traditional NLU engines far behind.

## IBM Watson NLU: Deep Foundations, Limited Flexibility

IBM Watson NLU has long been a reputable product in the AI field, specializing in extracting valuable information from text data. Its ability to recognize entities, emotions, and relationships allows companies to gain insights from customer data and social media conversation data.

Here's a summary of IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) functions and capabilities:

- **Text Analysis**: Uses deep learning to extract meaning and metadata from unstructured text data.
- **Semantic Functions**: Analyzes text categories, concepts, emotions, entities, keywords, sentiments, relationships, and grammar.
- **Language Support**: Data centers in multiple locations and supports 13 different languages depending on function.
- **Deployment**: Firewall, can be built on multiple cloud services.
- **Customization**: Can be trained using Watson Knowledge Studio to understand your business language and extract customized insights.
- **Real-time Insights**: Provides tools to extract metadata and patterns from large amounts of data.
- **Entity Detection**: Recognizes people, places, events, and other types of entities mentioned in content.
- **Classification**: Classifies data using a five-level classification hierarchy.
- **Concept Recognition**: Recognizes high-level concepts not directly mentioned in content.
- **Emotion and Sentiment Analysis**: Extracts emotions and analyzes sentiments toward specific target phrases or entire documents.
- **Relationship Understanding**: Understands the relationship between two entities in content.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Quickly extracts information such as author, title, images, and publication date from documents.
- **Grammar Parsing**: Parses sentences into subject-verb-object form.

#### The strengths of Watson NLU include:

- **Deep Text Analysis**: Extracts large amounts of data from texts, including entities, keywords, concepts, and emotion analysis.
- **Customization**: Customizes analysis according to your specific industry and terminology for accurate results.
- **Multilingual Support**: Analyzes texts in multiple languages, opening doors to a global audience.

#### However, in creating natural and engaging chat experiences, Watson NLU has limitations:

- **Limited Conversation Skills**: Designed for text analysis, it has difficulty understanding context and intent in fluid conversations.
- **Scripted Interactions**: Chatbot conversations powered by Watson NLU can feel rigid and pre-scripted.
- **Development Complexity**: Building complex chatbots requires considerable programming expertise.

## SeaChat: Paving the Way for the Future of Chat
SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, breaks the traditional chat experience pattern and provides:

- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: LLMs excel at understanding the nuances of human language, enabling SeaChat to conduct natural, context-driven conversations with users.
- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, constantly improving its ability to handle complex queries.
- **Seamless User Experience**: By understanding context and intent, SeaChat promotes more natural, human-like conversation interactions.

Here's why SeaChat is the future of chatbots:

- **Natural Conversations**: Users crave chatbots that feel like conversing with a real person, which SeaChat delivers through LLM technology.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Compared to NLU engines, building chatbots with SeaChat requires less code, saving you time and resources.
- **Growing Scalability**: SeaChat effortlessly handles large volumes of user interactions, ensuring smooth operation even during peak times.
