The world of chatbots is evolving at an astonishing pace. While Meta/Facebook's [wit.ai](http://wit.ai) served as the foundation for building voice-driven applications, a new technological wave is slowly becoming the center of attention: Large Language Models (LLMs). [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform built on LLM technology, provides a revolutionary approach to conversational AI, leaving the intent-based wit.ai far behind. Is it time to consider upgrading your chatbot?

### wit.ai: A Simple Entry Point, But Limited Scope

wit.ai as a user-friendly platform is often used to build basic voice interfaces. Its intent recognition-focused technology allows developers to start quickly and create simple applications.

Here are some advantages of wit.ai:

- **Accessibility**: An intuitive interface simplifies the creation of basic voice interfaces, making it a good choice for beginners or small-scale projects.
- **Focus on Intent Recognition**: Extracting user intentions from spoken language is the core of wit.ai's functionality. This can be helpful for tasks that only require simple user inputs.
- **Free Plan**: wit.ai offers a free plan, making it a choice for developers with limited budgets or those experimenting with voice applications.

However, as your chatbot project grows in complexity, wit.ai's limitations become apparent:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Understanding the nuances of human language and context is beyond wit.ai's capabilities. This results in a rigid and unnatural conversation flow.
- **Scripted Interactions**: wit.ai primarily relies on predefined intents, forcing conversations along a rigid path. This cannot capture the dynamic nature of spoken language.
- **Scalability Issues**: Performance may decline when handling many user interactions, hindering growth potential.

## SeaChat: Paving the Way for the Future of Conversational AI

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a tremendous leap in conversational AI, leaving wit.ai's limitations behind:

- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: SeaChat excels at understanding the nuances of human language, enabling natural, context-driven conversations.
- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, constantly improving its ability to handle complex queries.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Through understanding context and intentions, SeaChat facilitates a more natural conversation flow, mimicking human interactions.

Here's why SeaChat can enhance your conversational AI:

- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Users crave chatbots that feel like talking to a real person. SeaChat's advanced NLU capabilities, powered by LLMs, deliver on this promise, creating a more engaging and satisfying user experience.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Compared to intent-based engines like wit.ai, building chatbots with SeaChat typically requires less code. This frees up development resources to build robust features.
- **Growing Scalability**: SeaChat easily handles many user interactions, ensuring smooth operation even during peak times. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses with high growth potential.

Research has shown that the difference between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU in training examples is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): in training data requirements, it's 630,000 examples versus just 32. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings when businesses adopt GenAI/LLM-based NLU.

## SeaChat Can Provide a Better Conversation Experience
The future of conversational AI lies in natural, engaging interactions. While wit.ai has fulfilled its mission as a basic voice interface builder, SeaChat offers a revolutionary approach powered by LLMs. Consider upgrading your chatbot to [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) for a more dynamic and human-like experience.
