SeaX + SeaChat is a complete AI voice assistant solution launched by Seasalt.ai, specifically designed to address core issues in the senior care industry. This system can not only make automatic outbound senior care calls and interact with seniors through voice, but also achieve regular care, surveys, and many other functions, comprehensively improving the quality and efficiency of long-term care services. Let's dive deep into how this innovative solution addresses the challenges of the long-term care industry.

### Immediate Care:

For seniors living alone who need immediate support or dementia patients who require special care, traditional phone systems often cannot respond in time. SeaX + SeaChat can make automatic outbound senior care calls or send messages, such as using senior emergency phones or senior emergency messages, to ensure seniors receive immediate care and support at any time. Whether it's daily regular care or emergency situations, relevant staff can be quickly notified.

### Diverse Services:

With the increasing number of elderly people in Taiwan, providing diverse services has become an urgent need for the long-term care industry. SeaX + SeaChat supports multiple communication channels, including voice calls, text messages, and WhatsApp, and can be integrated into day care center services and emergency rescue systems, achieving personalized telemedicine, emotional companionship, and other diverse services. These functions can effectively reduce the manpower burden on long-term care institutions and ensure every senior receives personalized care.

### Manpower Optimization:

Manpower shortage is another major challenge facing the long-term care industry. Through SeaX + SeaChat, highly repetitive and time-consuming care work can be automated, greatly reducing the workload of volunteers and medical staff. Additionally, the system's built-in real-time call content analysis function can effectively improve communication efficiency, helping staff better allocate resources and focus on cases that need special attention.

## ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Success Case:

A successful case comes from a national long-term care institution in Singapore. The institution originally faced problems with manpower shortage and low care frequency. After adopting the SeaX + SeaChat solution, they achieved the following improvements in long-term care quality:

- Increased care frequency from once annually to once monthly
- 24-hour automatic answering, ensuring seniors receive responses at any time
- Automatic tracking of missed calls and cases that haven't checked in
- Annual savings of approximately 10,000 hours of volunteer phone time
- Volunteers freed from tedious routine work to focus on providing more refined services

This case clearly demonstrates the enormous potential of AI voice assistants in the senior care field. By providing immediate, personalized care services, SeaX + SeaChat not only improves the quality and efficiency of long-term care services but also provides an innovative solution to the manpower shortage problem.

## Future Outlook:

With Taiwan's aging problem becoming increasingly severe, SeaX + SeaChat will play an increasingly important role in senior care. This system can not only improve service quality and efficiency but also solve the manpower challenges facing the long-term care industry. Through technological innovation, we will provide better and more comprehensive care for seniors on our path toward a super-aged society.
