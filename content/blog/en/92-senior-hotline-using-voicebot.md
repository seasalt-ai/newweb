SeaX + SeaChat is a complete AI voice assistant solution launched by Seasalt.ai, specifically designed to address core issues in the elderly care industry. This system can not only automatically make outbound calls for elderly care, interact with seniors through voice, but also achieve regular care, questionnaire surveys, and other functions, comprehensively improving the quality and efficiency of long-term care services. Let's delve into how this innovative solution addresses the challenges of the long-term care industry.

### Immediate Care:

For elderly individuals living alone who need immediate support or dementia patients who require special care, traditional telephone systems often cannot respond in a timely manner. SeaX + SeaChat can make automated outbound calls or send messages for elderly care, such as using elderly pager phones or elderly care messages, ensuring that seniors receive immediate care and support at all times. Whether it's daily regular care or in emergency situations, relevant personnel can be notified quickly.

### Diverse Services:

With the increasing elderly population in Taiwan, providing diversified services has become an urgent need for the long-term care industry. SeaX + SeaChat supports multiple communication channels, including voice calls, text messages, and WhatsApp, and can be integrated into day care center services and emergency rescue systems, realizing personalized remote medical care, emotional companionship, and other diverse services. These functions can effectively reduce the human resource burden of long-term care institutions, ensuring that every senior receives personalized care.

### Human Resource Optimization:

Human resource shortages are another major challenge facing the long-term care industry. Through SeaX + SeaChat, highly repetitive and time-consuming care tasks can be automated, greatly reducing the workload of volunteers and medical staff. In addition, the system's built-in real-time call content analysis function can effectively improve communication efficiency, helping staff better allocate resources and focus on cases requiring special attention.

## ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Success Story:

A success story comes from a national long-term care institution in Singapore. The institution originally faced problems of insufficient human resources and low frequency of care. After adopting the SeaX + SeaChat solution, they achieved the following improvements in the quality of long-term care:

- Care frequency increased from once a year to once a month
- 24-hour automatic answering, ensuring seniors can receive responses at any time
- Automatic tracking of missed calls and unchecked-in cases
- Saving approximately ten thousand hours of volunteer phone time per year
- Volunteers are freed from tedious routine work and can focus on providing more refined services

This case fully demonstrates the huge potential of AI voice assistants in the field of elderly care. By providing immediate, personalized care services, SeaX + SeaChat not only improves the quality and efficiency of long-term care services but also provides an innovative solution to the problem of insufficient human resources.

## Future Outlook:

As Taiwan's aging problem becomes increasingly severe, SeaX + SeaChat will play an increasingly important role in elderly care. The system can not only improve the quality and efficiency of services but also solve the human resource challenges faced by the long-term care industry. Through technological innovation, we will provide better and more comprehensive care for the elderly on the road to a super-aging society.
